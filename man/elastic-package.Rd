\description{
An Elasticsearch R client.
}
\section{About}{


This package gives you access to local or remote Elasticsearch databases.
}

\section{Quick start}{


If you're connecting to a Elasticsearch server already running, skip ahead to \strong{Search}

Install Elasticsearch (on OSX)
\itemize{
\item Download zip or tar file from Elasticsearch see here for download:
\url{https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch}
\item Unzip it: \verb{untar elasticsearch-2.3.5.tar.gz}
\item Move it: \verb{sudo mv elasticsearch-2.3.5 /usr/local}
(replace version with your version)
\item Navigate to /usr/local: \code{cd /usr/local}
\item Add shortcut: \verb{sudo ln -s elasticsearch-2.3.5 elasticsearch}
(replace version with your version)
}

For help on other platforms, see
\url{https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/install-elasticsearch.html}

\strong{Start Elasticsearch}
\itemize{
\item Navigate to elasticsearch: \code{cd /usr/local/elasticsearch}
\item Start elasticsearch: \code{bin/elasticsearch}
}

\strong{Initialization}

The function \code{\link[=connect]{connect()}} is used before doing anything else to set
the connection details to your remote or local elasticsearch store. The
details created by \code{\link[=connect]{connect()}} are written to your options for the
current session, and are used by \code{elastic} functions.

\strong{Search}

The main way to search Elasticsearch is via the \code{\link[=Search]{Search()}} function. E.g.:

\code{Search()}
}

\section{Security}{


Elasticsearch is insecure out of the box! If you are running Elasticsearch
locally on your own machine without exposing a port to the outside world, no
worries, but if you install on a server with a public IP address, take the
necessary precautions. There are a few options:
\itemize{
\item Shield - A paid product - so probably only applicable to enterprise users
\item DIY security - there are a variety of techniques for securing your
Elasticsearch. I collected a number of resources in a blog post at
\url{https://recology.info/2015/02/secure-elasticsearch/}
}
}

\section{Elasticsearch changes}{

As of Elasticsearch v2:
\itemize{
\item You can no longer create fields with dots in the name.
\item Type names may not start with a dot (other than the special \code{.percolator} type)
\item Type names may not be longer than 255 characters
\item Types may no longer be deleted
\item Queries and filters have been merged - all filter clauses are now query clauses.
Instead, query clauses can now be used in query context or in filter context. See
examples in \code{\link[=Search]{Search()}} or \code{\link[=Search_uri]{Search_uri()}}
}
}

\section{index names}{

The following are illegal characters, and can not be used in index names or types:
\verb{\\\\}, \code{/}, \code{*}, \verb{?}, \code{<}, \code{>}, \code{|}, \verb{,} (comma). double quote and whitespace are
also illegal.
