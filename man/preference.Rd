Preferences

\details{
\itemize{
\item _primary The operation will go and be executed only on the primary shards.
\item _primary_first The operation will go and be executed on the primary shard, and if
not available (failover), will execute on other shards.
\item _local The operation will prefer to be executed on a local allocated shard if possible.
\item _only_node:xyz Restricts the search to execute only on a node with the provided
node id (xyz in this case).
\item _prefer_node:xyz Prefers execution on the node with the provided node
id (xyz in this case) if applicable.
\item _shards:2,3 Restricts the operation to the specified shards. (2 and 3 in this case).
This preference can be combined with other preferences but it has to appear
first: _shards:2,3;_primary
\item Custom (string) value A custom value will be used to guarantee that the same shards
will be used for the same custom value. This can help with "jumping values" when hitting
different shards in different refresh states. A sample value can be something like the web
session id, or the user name.
